Hi, Iâ€™m @fvd2, management consultant turned software developer

I develop full-stack web applications using JavaScript (front-end: React, back-end: Node.js / Express / MongoDB and Firebase)   

Some other topics I'm exploring (but there's only so many hours in a day): 
* linux
* Automation, including CI/CD
* TDD
* Software architecture
* nginx
